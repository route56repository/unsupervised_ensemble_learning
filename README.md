# Unsupervised Ensemble Learning with Dependent Classifiers
Repository containing all the codes used in the following paper:

* M. L. Turr√≥ and M. Cabrera-Bean, "Correlated Binary Data for Machine Learning," 2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 2021, pp. 1411-1415, doi: 10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616346.

All files are written in MATLAB R2020b. The file names containing '_main' are key functions that cluster and make use of other minor functions. The files are structured as follows:

* *method1_main.m*: generates correlated binary data using Method 1
  * *compute_prob.m*: generates the probabilities assigned to each set of classification results 
  * *allocate_prob.m*: generates correlated sets of classification results by allocating the previous probabilities 
* *method2_main.m*: generates correlated binary data using Method 2 
* *detect_structure_main.m*: detects the classifiers' correlation structure
  * *estimate_rank_1_matrix.m*: estimates diagonal values of a rank-one matrix
  * *tracemin.m*: estimates unknown entries of a rank-one matrix via trace minimization (IMPORTANT NOTE: this file makes use of the SDPT3 (version 4.0) solver, which may be found at https://github.com/Kim-ChuanToh/SDPT3)
  * *scorematrix.m*: computes the score matrix 
* *CEM_main.m*: provides ensemble estimates of ground truth labels using the CEM algorithm 
  * *assignfun.m*: computes the assignment function ***c*** from the indicator function 
* *LSM_main.m*: provides ensemble estimates of ground truth labels using the LSM algorithm 
  * *assignfun.m*: (already listed)
  * *estimate_ensemble_parameters.m*: estimates the ensemble's specificities and sensitivities, as well as the vector containing the weights used to compute the LSM-based ground truth labels
  * *estimate_class_imbalance_restricted_likelihood.m*: estimates the instances' class imbalance
  * *estimate_rank_1_matrix.m*: (already listed)
  * *tracemin.m*: (already listed)
